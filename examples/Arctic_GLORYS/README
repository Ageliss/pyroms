WARNING: I have only run the INI file script so far.

1. Note to self:

GLORYS has a default spval of -32.xxx for temp and salt. This is not
a good idea for ROMS, with its:

       IF (ABS(wrk(i)).ge.ABS(Aspval)) THEN
	   wrk(i)=0.0_r8                 ! masked with _FillValue

You need:

ncatted -a _FillValue,temp,m,d,1.e37 -a _FillValue,salt,m,d,1.e37
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_1998010_ic_ARCTIC2.nc

(at least for salt).


2. I chose to combine the fields for one day into one for the initial
conditions. It's kind of a pain, so you probably want to handle the
boundary conditions field by field, then combine them afterwards.

Some of the history:
		:history = "Thu Aug 20 15:21:10 2015: ncks
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102.nc
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102_V.nc\n",
			"Thu Aug 20 15:10:53 2015: ncks
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102_ice.nc
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102.nc\n",
			"Thu Aug 20 15:10:40 2015: ncrename -d
deptht,depth_one
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102_icemod_R19980107.nc
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_19980102_ice.nc"

3. This is an arctic domain, using yrange to subset the world.
A more equatorial problem should use irange, jrange instead. Be
consistent and edit all the *.py files here consistently.
