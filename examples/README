Here are some examples of using the pyroms package (plus maybe a few
plain python examples).

For those of us who don't have the grid information in every ROMS
output file, the gridid.txt file here is used to provide some
information to pyroms about our grids. Point to it with the
PYROMS_GRIDID_FILE environment variable.

The Yellow_Sea directory contains code for creating a grid,
bathymetry, initial and boundary files (the last from SODA,
http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/).

The Arctic2 directory has code for interpolating from SODA across all
longitudes. It also shows how to use multiprocessing for the boundary
conditions and climatology files - be sure to set the number of processes
desired.

For creating initial and boundary files from larger ROMS grids,
there are two cases:

1. Where the small grid is aligned with the large grid, no velocity
rotation needed. See the Bering directory.

2. Where the grids are not aligned and velocities need to be rotated.
See the Chukchi example.

In either case, run make_weight_file.py first.

New: HYCOM scripts in Arctic_HYCOM - scripts to get the HYCOM files
(subsets of the global fields) and scripts to interpolate from them.
In the pyroms_toolbox/pyroms_toolbox/Grid_HYCOM directory there is a
makefile and a creeping_sea.f90. Use them to:

    compile creeping_sea.f90 -> creep.so
    put creep.so somewhere in PYTHONPATH
