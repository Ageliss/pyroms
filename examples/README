Here are some examples of using the pyroms package (plus maybe a few
plain python examples).

For those of us who don't have the grid information in every ROMS
output file, the gridid.txt file here is used to provide some
information to pyroms about our grids. Point to it with the
PYROMS_GRIDID_FILE environment variable.

The Yellow_Sea directory contains code for creating a grid,
bathymetry, initial and boundary files (the last from SODA,
http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/).

The Arctic directory has code for interpolating from SODA across all
longitudes.

For creating initial and boundary files from larger ROMS grids,
there are two cases:

1. Where the small grid is aligned with the large grid, no velocity
rotation needed. See the Bering directory.

2. Where the grids are not aligned and velocities need to be rotated.
See the Chukchi example.

In either case, run make_weight_file.py first.
